#### RESEARCH

#### 1. Describe @Input Decorator (info.component.ts)

This creates a data-binding point. It allows data to be passed to a child component from its parent. In this project, the value is passed from the info selector in shop.component.html in the following line of code:

```<app-info [name]="answer" *ngIf="answer != 'unknown'"></app-info>```

#### 2. Describe [value] (info.component.html)

As shown above, the [name] value is passed to the constructor within the export of info.component.ts using the app-info selector, which loads the info module. This is how data is passed when data-binding is being used. 

#### 3. Describe [(ngModel)] (info.component.html)

Importing the FormsModule allows 2-way data binding. Adding this property to an HTML Form element causes changes to the input field to update the assigned variable's value in the component. Likewise, changing the variable value on the backend will update the input field's value.
