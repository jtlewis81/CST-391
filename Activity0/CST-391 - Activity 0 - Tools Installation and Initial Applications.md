Notes about the assignment:
- I encountered the issue with not being able to run scripts in Windows, and needing to use PowerShell to enable it, earlier than it was mentioned. I was able to figure it out on my own before finding the mention further down in the instructions.
- Since we put the app.ts file in a folder called "src", the command had to be "ts-node src/app.ts" instead of just "ts-node app.ts". Otherwise, an error occurs regarding a missing module.
